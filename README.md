# Obsidian Theme - Purple Aurora

This is a dark theme for the personal knowledge base app [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). This is my (pretty basic) submission for the Obsidian October 2021 event.

The two main inspirations for this theme are aurora borealis as well as my favorite color dark purple. I wanted this to give the impression of the blue and minty green colors of an aurora borealis against a dark purple sky. Aurora borealis is something that I could look at for forever and I would like to have a similar feeling with my color scheme in Obsidian.

Currently the plugins I have made specific changes to are the Calendar and Kanban Plugins.

A big thank you to the friendly people in the Obsidian Discord who helped me out with the basic CSS questions I had when I started out!

Credit to the Obsidian forum page for [common CSS hacks](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978) from which I took some inspiration (and snippets!).
